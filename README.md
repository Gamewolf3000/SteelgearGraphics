# SteelgearGraphics

SteelgearGraphics is a framework for rendering using the direct3D 11 API. The main idea of the framework is to provide a way to both an automated and simple way to handle the different d3d11 resources and components, and a way to construct pipelines that utilize these resources. To make this possible the framework uses an entity component system that allows resources that can be bound to graphical entities and when needed to execute a job they are automatically fetched. No need to manually manage and fetch things like constant buffers from game objects or have to redesign rendering code when the pipeline changes. Instead you can just create the resources needed and bind them to entities as fits using a GUID system. In addition, the framework is built to allow for multithreading in two different ways. Firstly, the whole rendering logic can be run on a thread of its own, decoupling things like game logic and physics updates from the rendering. Secondly, the actual rendering commands can be run on a configurable amount of threads to allow multiple graphical command lists to be built in parallel.
